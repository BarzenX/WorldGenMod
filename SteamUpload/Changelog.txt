1.0.5
- made the Golden Lake smaller (reduces gold ore from around 2000 to around 800) and...
- added a config option to make the Golden Lake even smaller (around 400 gold ore)
- overhauled the Frost Fortress:
-> almost a complete code rewrite!
-> decorated the rooms (I'm around 50% done of what I've planned to add)
-> added a third "dark" fortress design (really proud of that one!)
-> no more dynamite traps

1.0.2
- added the Chastised Church generation side option "Both"
- made the Gold Underground Lake creation configurable (some people might find it op if found early in the game)

1.0.1
