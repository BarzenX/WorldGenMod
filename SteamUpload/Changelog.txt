1.0.6.1
- removed the FossilArmor from room#3 ArmoryShowroom and room#5 Armory as it's too rewarding for the point at the game when the player finds the FrostFortress

1.0.6
- Made room#4 "Dormitory" leave its "quick and dirty" state: [url=https://i.imgur.com/4LCXXni.jpg] Preview [/url]
- Made room#5 "Armory" leave its "quick and dirty" state: [url=https://i.imgur.com/L1n7MAs.jpg] Preview [/url]
- created an option to alter the cobweb density in the Frost Fortress and added the same option for the Chastised Church (still without function, will make use of it when I finally rework the Chastised Church)

1.0.5
- made the Golden Lake smaller (reduces gold ore from around 2000 to around 800) and...
- added a config option to make the Golden Lake even smaller (around 400 gold ore)
- overhauled the Frost Fortress:
-> almost a complete code rewrite!
-> decorated the rooms (I'm around 50% done of what I've planned to add)
-> added a third "dark" fortress design (really proud of that one!)
-> no more dynamite traps

1.0.2
- added the Chastised Church generation side option "Both"
- made the Gold Underground Lake creation configurable (some people might find it op if found early in the game)

1.0.1
- made the Chastised Church generation side configurable

1.0.0
- initial upload after update (includes Fissure and smaller Underground Lakes)
